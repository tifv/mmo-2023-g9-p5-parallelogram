> A regular 100-gon was cut into several parallelograms and two triangles.
Prove that these triangles are congruent.

A problem by A. Yuran, featured in the Moscow Mathematical Olympiad
(year 2023, problem 9.3).

This animation demonstrates something of an inverse problem:
given the regular 2n-gon and two equal triangles inside it,
split the remaining area into parallelograms.
This is possible for certain positions of triangles, but not for all.
